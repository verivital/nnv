Initial states:
x1 = [-0.45, -0.44]
x2 = [-0.55, -0.54]
x3 = [0.65, 0.66]
x4 = [-0.75, -0.74]
x5 = [0.85, 0.86]
x6 = [-0.65, -0.64]

t = 3 seconds
control period = 0.1 s

Safety Property:
We would like to verify whether the system will reach the following unsafe
set Xu in 3 seconds (30 time steps), where Xu is defined as a 6-dimensional region:

x1 ∈ [-0.2,0],     x2 ∈ [-0.5, -0.4],  x3 ∈ [0, 0.2]
x4 ∈ [-0.7, -0.6]  x5 ∈ [0.7, 0.8],  x6 ∈ [-0.4, -0.2]
